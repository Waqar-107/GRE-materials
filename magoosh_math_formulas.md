# Magoosh's Complete Guide to Math Formulas

1. real numbers : int, float.
2. order of operation: `PEMDAS`. parenthesis > exponents > multiply/divison > add/subtract
3. remember some of the primes `3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59…`
4. anu numbers will be in the format 2<sup>a</sup> * 3<sup>b</sup> * 5<sup>c</sup>. if there is x, y, z choices of values for a,b,c then total factor will be `x * y * z`
5. `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`
6. divisibility rules,
    * if sum of digits % 3 == 0 then divisible by 3
    * if last 2 digits of number % 4 == then divisible by 4
    * if last digit is either 0 or 5 then divisible by 5
    * if sum of digits % 3 == 0 and sum of digits % 2 == 0 then divisible 6
    * if last three digits are divisible by 8 then the number is divisible by 8
    * if sum of digits is divisible by 9 then the number is divisible by 9
7. ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c then x would be

8. total degrees of polygon = 180(n-2), where n = total sides
9. avg degrees per side of polygon = ((n - 2) / n) * 180
10. area of triangle = `0.5 * b * h`
11. An isosceles right triangle (45-45-90) has sides in a ratio of x : x : x√2.
12. A 30-60-90 triangle has sides in a ratio of x:x√3:2x, with the 1x side opposite the 30 degree angle.
13. An equilateral triangle has three equal sides. Each angle is equal to 60 degrees.
14. A right triangle has a right angle (a 90 degree angle); the side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, and is always the longest side.
15. Each side of certain right triangles are integers. These sets of numbers are called Pythagorean triples, and you should memorize some of them: 3-4-5, 5-12-13, 8-15-17, 7-24-25. A multiple of a Pythagorean triple is a Pythagorean triple (e.g., 6-8-10).
16. The length of the longest side can never be greater than the sum of the two other sides.
17. The length of the shortest side can never be less than the positive difference of the other two sides.
18. area of a circle = pi * r<sup>2</sup>
19. circumference of a circle = 2 * pi * r
20. arc len = (2 * pi * r * x) / 360
21. area of sector = (pi * r<sup>2</sup>) / 360
